/*
 * Subclass overrides the methods of superclass but it hides the variables of
 * superclass.
 * 
 * Line n3 hides the variable created at Line n1 and Line n4 overrides the
 * getNotation() method of Line n2. There is no compilation error for USDollar
 * class as it correctly overrides getNotation() method.
 * 
 * Similarly, Line n5 hides the variable created at Line n1 and Line n6
 * overrides the getNotation() method of Line n2. There is no compilation error
 * for Euro class as it correctly overrides getNotation() method as well.
 * 
 * 'c1' is of Currency type, hence c1.notation refers to "-" and
 * c1.getNotation() invokes overriding method of USDollar class and it returns
 * "$".
 * 
 * Similarly, c2.notation refers to "-" and c2.getNotation() invokes overriding
 * method of Euro class and it returns "â‚¬".
