/*
 * According to overriding rules, if super class / interface method declares to
 * throw a checked exception, then overriding method of sub class / implementer
 * class has following options:
 * 
 * 1. May not declare to throw any checked exception.
 * 
 * 2. May declare to throw the same checked exception thrown by super class /
 * interface method.
 * 
 * 3. May declare to throw the sub class of the exception thrown by super class
 * / interface method.
 * 
 * 4. Cannot declare to throw the super class of the exception thrown by super
 * class / interface method.
 * 
 * 5. Cannot declare to throw unrelated checked exception.
 * 
 * 6. May declare to throw any RuntimeException or Error.
 * 
 * default methods were added in Java 8 and TravelBlogger class correctly
 * overrides the default method blog() of Blogger interface. Blogger interface
 * compiles successfully.
 * 
 * At Line n1, 'blogger' is of Blogger type (supertype) and it refers to an
 * instance of TravelBlogger class (subtype), this is polymorphism and allowed
 * in Java. Line n1 compiles successfully.
 * 
 * At Line n2, blog() method is being invoked on typecasting 'blogger' to
 * TravelBlogger and as TravelBlogger class doesn't declare to throw any checked
 * exception, hence Line n2 compiles successfully.
 * 
 * As instance is of TravelBlogger type, therefore on execution, Line n2 invokes
 * blog() method of TravelBlogger instance, which prints TRAVEL on to the
 * console.
