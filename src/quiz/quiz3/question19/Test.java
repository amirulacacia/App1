/*
 * As per Java 8, default and static methods were added in the interface.
 * Interface M defines static method log(), there is no compilation error in
 * interface M.
 * 
 * Also the scope of static log() method of M is limited to interface M and it
 * can be invoked by using Interface name only, M.log().
 * 
 * Abstract class A also defines the static log() method. Abstract class can
 * have 0 or more abstract methods. Hence, no compilation error in class A as
 * well.
 * 
 * Super type reference variable can refer to an instance of Sub type, therefore
 * the statement `M obj1 = new MyClass();` compiles successfully.
 * 
 * obj1 is of M type, hence `obj1.log();` tries to tag the static method of M
 * but static log() method of M can only be invoked by using M.log();.
 * 
 * Therefore, Line n1 causes compilation error.
 * 
 * Scope of static log() method of A is not limited to class A only but MyClass
 * also gets A.log() method in its scope.
 * 
 * There are different ways in which static method of an abstract class can be
 * accessed:
 * 
 * 1. By using the name of the abstract class: A.log(); //Preferred way
 * 
 * 2. By using the reference variable of abstract class: A o1 = null; o1.log();
 * 
 * 3. By using the name of the subclass: MyClass.log();
 * 
 * 4. By using the reference variable of the subclass: MyClass o2 = null;
 * o2.log();
 * 
 * Hence, Line n2 and Line n3 compile successfully.
