/*
 * Subclass overrides the methods of superclass but it hides the variables of
 * superclass.
 * 
 * Line n2 hides the variable created at Line n1, there is no rules related to
 * hiding (type and access modifier can be changed).
 * 
 * At Line n3, obj1 is of Base type and refers to an instance of Base class.
 * 
 * At Line n4, obj2 is of Base type and refers to an instance of Derived class.
 * 
 * At Line n5, as obj2 refers to an instance of Derived class, hence typecasting
 * it to Derived type doesn't cause any Exception. obj3 is of Derived type and
 * refers to an instance of Derived class.
 * 
 * Let's check the expression of Line n6:
 * 
 * obj1.msg + "-" + obj2.msg + "-" + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * => (obj1.msg + "-") + obj2.msg + "-" + obj3.msg; //+ operator is left to
 * right associative and behaves as concatenation operator as one of the operand
 * is of String type.
 * 
 * => ((obj1.msg + "-") + obj2.msg) + "-" + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * => (((obj1.msg + "-") + obj2.msg) + "-") + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * Let's solve the expression now:
 * 
 * => ((("INHALE" + "-") + obj2.msg) + "-") + obj3.msg; //obj1 is of Base type,
 * hence obj1.msg refers to "INHALE"
 * 
 * => (("INHALE-" + obj2.msg) + "-") + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * => (("INHALE-" + "INHALE") + "-") + obj3.msg; //obj2 is of Base type, hence
 * obj2.msg refers to "INHALE"
 * 
 * => ("INHALE-INHALE" + "-") + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * => "INHALE-INHALE-" + obj3.msg;
 * 
 * In above expression, left operand is of String type and right operand is of
 * Object type, so toString() method is invoked. So, given expression is
 * evaluated as:
 * 
 * => "INHALE-INHALE-" + obj3.msg.toString();
 * 
 * => "INHALE-INHALE-" + "EXHALE"; //As obj3.msg is of Object type and refers to
 * an instance of String type, hence toString() method on "EXHALE" instance is
 * invoked and this returns "EXHALE".
 * 
 * => "INHALE-INHALE-EXHALE";
 * 
 * Line n7 prints INHALE-INHALE-EXHALE on to the console.
